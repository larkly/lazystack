# lazystack — Product Requirements Document

## Overview

**lazystack** is a keyboard-driven terminal UI for OpenStack, built with Go. It follows the "lazy" convention (lazygit, lazydocker) to signal a fast, keyboard-first alternative to Horizon and the verbose OpenStack CLI. The goal is to make day-to-day OpenStack operations — especially VM lifecycle management — fast and intuitive from the terminal.

**License**: Apache 2.0
**Language**: Go
**Target cloud**: Any OpenStack cloud with Keystone v3, Nova v2.1+ (tested against cloud.rlnc.eu with microversion 2.100)

| Phase 6: Operational | ✓ Complete | Service catalog browser, hypervisor view, admin server actions (Cold Migrate, Live Migrate, Evacuate, Force Delete, Reset State), metadata browser, user management — all done via PR #168 |

## Concerns and Considerations

### Architecture

- **Value receiver pattern**: Bubble Tea v2 uses value receivers for `Update()`, which means model mutations require returning new values. This interacts poorly with optimistic UI updates — changes made before an async command fires can be overwritten when the command's response arrives and gets routed through `updateActiveView`. This caused the resize confirmation banner to flicker (optimistic status set to ACTIVE, then stale API response overwrote it back to VERIFY_RESIZE). Solved with a `pendingAction` state that suppresses stale updates until the real state catches up.

- **Message routing complexity**: The root model routes messages to sub-views via a `switch` on the active view. Adding overlay modals (resize picker, confirm, error, help) that intercept messages creates ordering dependencies in the `Update` method. The resize modal being `Active` was swallowing messages meant for other views. Each new modal/overlay adds routing complexity — consider a message bus or middleware pattern if this grows further. Phase 4's refactor split app.go from 1,643 lines into 7 focused files (app.go, actions_server.go, actions_resource.go, routing.go, render.go, connect.go, tabs.go), which makes this manageable for now.

- **Import cycle avoidance**: Shared types (keys, styles, messages) live in `internal/shared/` rather than `internal/app/` to avoid import cycles between `app` and the UI packages. This is a pragmatic workaround but means the "app" package is really just the root model + view routing.

### UX Lessons Learned

- **Ctrl-prefixed dangerous actions**: Originally used `c`/`d`/`r` for create/delete/reboot. Changed to `ctrl+n`/`ctrl+d`/`ctrl+o` after realizing typing in the wrong terminal window could trigger destructive operations. This is a good pattern for any keyboard-first TUI.

- **Optimistic UI is essential for async APIs**: OpenStack actions like `confirmResize` return 202 (accepted) but the server state doesn't change immediately. Polling the API right after the action often returns stale state. The `pendingAction` pattern — show the expected state immediately and suppress stale API responses until the real state catches up — provides much better UX than waiting for the tick.

- **Column adaptivity matters**: Fixed-width columns don't work across terminal sizes. The flex-weight + priority system (columns get proportional extra space, and low-priority columns hide on narrow terminals) works well. IPv6 addresses (39 chars) are particularly challenging — they need the highest flex weight but lowest display priority since they're rarely needed at a glance.

- **Modal vs view**: The resize flavor picker was initially a full view, which caused navigation issues (Esc from resize opened from the list panicked because there was no detail view to go back to). Converting it to a modal overlay that sits on top of the current view eliminated the problem entirely. Prefer modals for transient selection UI.

- **Auto-refresh must survive view changes**: The server list's auto-refresh tick was breaking when navigating to other views because the tick message got routed to the wrong view. Fixed with `updateAllViews` that routes non-key messages to all initialized tab views. Modal overlays (resize, FIP picker) must not swallow background ticks — route to all views first, then to the active modal.

- **Tick chain fragility**: Each view's auto-refresh is a chain: tick fires → fetch + schedule next tick. If any message in the chain gets swallowed (e.g., by a modal that doesn't handle it), the chain breaks permanently. The fix is to always route messages to background views before routing to modal overlays.

### Technical Debt

- **Bulk action support is partial**: Space-select works for delete, reboot, pause, suspend, shelve, and resize. Console log only operates on a single server (the cursor, not the selection), which is intentional since console log is inherently single-server. Bulk resize applies the same target flavor to all selected servers.

- **Image name resolution**: Nova's server response doesn't include the image name (only ID) with newer microversions. The server list fetches all images from Glance to resolve names, which works but adds an extra API call on every refresh. Should cache more aggressively or resolve lazily.

- **Server detail refresh creates a new model**: After actions from the detail view, the detail model is recreated with `New()` + `Init()` to force a fresh fetch. This resets scroll position and loses the pending action state if not carefully managed. A proper `Refresh()` method on the detail model would be cleaner.

- **Limited tests**: The codebase has minimal test coverage (cloud, compute, serverlist columns). The compute layer functions are thin wrappers around gophercloud and would benefit from interface-based mocking. The UI components are harder to test but snapshot testing of `View()` output would catch rendering regressions.

- **Error handling in bulk operations**: Bulk actions collect errors and report them as a single concatenated string. Individual failure tracking and partial success reporting would be better UX.

### OpenStack API Considerations

- **Microversion dependency**: The app sets microversion `2.100` on the compute client. This means it requires a relatively recent Nova deployment. The `original_name` field in the flavor response (used for display) requires microversion 2.47+. Should gracefully degrade for older clouds.

- **Image map structure varies by microversion**: The `image` field in the server response is `map[string]any` and its contents depend on the microversion. With 2.100, it typically only contains `id` and `links` — no `name`. Boot-from-volume servers have an empty image map.

- **Unshelve requires non-nil opts**: gophercloud's `Unshelve()` panics if passed `nil` opts (it calls `opts.ToUnshelveMap()` on the nil interface). Must pass `servers.UnshelveOpts{}`. This is arguably a gophercloud bug.

- **Locked server awareness**: The server list shows a 🔒 icon for locked servers, but doesn't prevent actions on them — the API will reject the action and the error modal will display. Could pre-check lock status and show a more helpful message.

## Problem Statement

OpenStack operators and developers lack a fast, keyboard-driven terminal interface:

- **Horizon** is slow, requires a browser, and is painful for repetitive tasks
- **The OpenStack CLI** is verbose — simple operations require long commands with many flags
- **No Go-based TUI alternative exists** for OpenStack management

lazystack fills this gap by providing a single binary that connects to any OpenStack cloud via `clouds.yaml` and presents a navigable, auto-refreshing interface for the most common operations.

## Core Principles

1. **Keyboard-first**: Every action is reachable via keyboard shortcuts. Mouse support is not a goal.
2. **Fast startup**: Connect and show servers in under 2 seconds on a healthy cloud.
3. **Non-destructive by default**: Destructive actions require Ctrl-prefixed shortcuts and confirmation modals.
4. **Minimal configuration**: Reads standard `clouds.yaml` — no additional config files needed.
5. **Single binary**: No runtime dependencies beyond the compiled Go binary.
6. **Safe by default**: Can't accidentally trigger destructive actions by typing in the wrong window.

## Target Users

- OpenStack operators managing VMs across one or more clouds
- Developers who provision and tear down test instances frequently
- Anyone who prefers terminal workflows over web UIs

## Features

### Phase 1: MVP (Complete)

#### Cloud Connection
- Parse `clouds.yaml` from standard locations: `./clouds.yaml`, `$OS_CLIENT_CONFIG_FILE`, `~/.config/openstack/clouds.yaml`, `/etc/openstack/clouds.yaml`
- Cloud picker overlay when multiple clouds are configured
- Auto-select when only one cloud exists (override with `--pick-cloud` flag)
- Switch clouds at any time with `C`
- Authentication via Keystone v3 using gophercloud's `clouds.Parse` + `config.NewProviderClient`

#### Server List
- Adaptive columns with flex weights — columns grow to fill terminal width
- Priority-based column hiding on narrow terminals (Name/Status always visible, IPv6 hides first)
- Columns: Name, Status (with power state), IPv4, IPv6, Floating IP, Flavor, Image, Age, Key
- Image names resolved from Glance (Nova only returns image ID with microversion 2.100)
- Lock indicator (🔒) on server names
- Auto-refresh at configurable interval (default 5s, set with `--refresh` flag)
- Auto-refresh persists across view changes (ticks always route to server list)
- Client-side filtering with `/` (case-insensitive match on name, ID, status, IPs, flavor, image)
- Status/power colors: ACTIVE/RUNNING=green, BUILD=yellow, SHUTOFF=gray, ERROR=red, REBOOT=cyan
- Bulk selection with `space` (selected servers shown with ● prefix in purple)
- LAZYSTACK branding badge in top-right corner

#### Server Detail
- Two-column property list: name, ID, status, power state, flavor, image (name + ID), keypair, locked, tenant, AZ, created, security groups, volumes
- Networks section: IPs grouped by network name with type and version info
- Auto-refresh at same interval as server list
- Scrollable viewport
- Resize pending banner with confirm/revert actions
- Pending action state — optimistic UI that suppresses stale API responses
- Empty fields hidden for cleaner display

#### Server Create
- Form fields: Name, Image, Flavor, Network, Key Pair (inline filterable pickers), User Data (cloud-init file picker), Count
- User data field opens file picker for cloud-init scripts (.yaml, .yml, .sh, .cfg, .txt, .conf, extensionless)
- Count field (1–100) for batch creation using Nova's `min_count`/`max_count`
- Parallel resource fetching on form open (images, flavors, networks, keypairs)
- Type-to-filter in picker dropdowns
- Cursor advances to next field after picker selection
- Focusable Submit/Cancel buttons with hotkey labels
- Navigation: Tab/Shift+Tab/Arrow keys between fields, Enter to open pickers
- Submit via button or Ctrl+S hotkey

#### Confirmation Modals
- Required for all server state-change actions (delete, reboot, stop/start, pause, suspend, shelve, lock/unlock, rescue/unrescue)
- Supports both single-server and bulk operations
- Focusable [y] Confirm / [n] Cancel buttons
- Navigate buttons with arrow keys, Tab, or use hotkeys directly
- Defaults to Cancel for safety

#### Error Handling
- API errors displayed in modal with context
- Dismissible with Enter or Esc
- Network errors during auto-refresh shown in status bar (non-blocking)
- Missing clouds.yaml shows helpful error with search paths

#### Help Overlay
- `?` toggles scrollable help overlay
- Keybindings grouped by context (Global, Server List, Server Detail, Create Form, Console Log, Modals)
- Scrollable with ↑/↓ when content doesn't fit

#### Status Bar
- Shows current cloud name, project, and region
- Context-sensitive key hints per view (adapts to server state, selection count)
- Sticky hints for action success messages (survives background auto-refresh, clears on next key press)
- Error/warning display
- Truncates gracefully when bar overflows

#### Edge Cases
- Terminal too small: centered warning with required dimensions (80x20 minimum)
- Empty server list: "press [ctrl+n] to create" message
- No clouds.yaml: error modal with guidance
- Ctrl+R restarts the app (re-exec with same flags) for rapid testing after rebuilds

### Phase 2: Extended Compute (Complete)

#### Server Actions
- Pause/unpause (`p`) — auto-detects current state
- Suspend/resume (`ctrl+z`) — auto-detects current state
- Shelve/unshelve (`ctrl+e`) — auto-detects current state
- Resize (`ctrl+f`) — modal flavor picker with filter, current flavor marked with ★
- Confirm resize (`ctrl+y`) / Revert resize (`ctrl+x`) with optimistic UI
- Hard reboot (`ctrl+p`)
- All toggle actions read server status from both list and detail views

#### Console Log Viewer (`l`)
- Scrollable console output (last 500 lines from Nova)
- `g`/`G` for top/bottom navigation
- `R` to refresh
- `Esc` returns to previous view

#### Action History (`a`)
- Scrollable list of all instance actions (create, reboot, resize, etc.)
- Shows action name, timestamp with relative age, request ID
- Failed actions highlighted in red
- `R` to refresh

#### Resize Flow
- Modal overlay (not a separate view) — sits on top of list or detail
- Flavor list auto-sizes to content (no wrapping)
- Current flavor dimmed with ★ indicator
- After resize, server enters VERIFY_RESIZE state
- Detail view shows contextual banner: "Resize pending — ctrl+y confirm • ctrl+x revert"
- Confirm/revert uses optimistic UI with pending action state
- Staggered re-fetch (0.5s, 2s) for non-resize actions to catch state transitions

#### Bulk Actions
- `space` toggles selection on current server (advances cursor)
- Selected servers shown with ● prefix and purple highlighting
- Status bar shows selection count and available bulk actions
- Bulk delete, reboot, pause, suspend, shelve, resize all work on selection
- Confirm modal shows "N servers" for bulk operations
- Selection auto-clears after action execution
- Errors collected and reported as single modal (partial success visible)

#### Server Detail Auto-Refresh
- Same configurable interval as server list
- `R` for manual refresh
- Immediate re-fetch after actions (delete navigates to list)
- Pending action state prevents stale responses from overwriting optimistic updates

### Phase 3: Additional Resources (Complete)

#### Tabbed Navigation
- Dynamic tabs built from service catalog (see Phase 4 refactor): Servers, Volumes, Floating IPs, Security Groups, Networks, Key Pairs (always present), Load Balancers (if Octavia available)
- Switch with number keys `1-9` or `←/→` from any top-level list view
- Tab bar with active tab highlighted, inactive tabs muted
- Each tab lazily initializes on first visit, auto-refreshes independently
- Background tick routing ensures all initialized tabs keep refreshing even when not active

#### Volume Management
- **Volume List**: Adaptive columns (Name, Status, Size, Type, Attached To, Device, Bootable), auto-refresh, sorting
- **Volume Detail**: Enter on a volume shows full properties — Name, ID, Status, Size, Type, AZ, Bootable, Encrypted, Multiattach, Description, Created, Updated, Snapshot ID, Source Volume ID, Attached Server (resolved name), Device, Metadata (key=value)

- **IPv6 handling**: Auto-addressed IPv6 subnets handled correctly when adding interfaces. Supports routers with multiple IPs on the same network

#### Column Sorting
- `s` cycles sort to next visible column (ascending), `S` toggles sort direction
- Active sort column shows ▲/▼ indicator
- Column header briefly highlights on sort change (1.5s)
- Sort persists through data refreshes
- Available on all list views (servers, volumes, floating IPs, key pairs)

#### Server Detail Enhancements
- **Networks section**: Shows IPs grouped by network name instead of flat lists
- **Assign Floating IP** (`Ctrl+A`): Opens FIP picker modal

#### Global Keybindings
- `R` force refresh — handled globally, dispatches to active view
- `PgUp/PgDn` — page navigation everywhere arrow keys work (lists, detail views, help modal)

#### Confirmation Modals
- Custom title and body text per resource type (e.g., "Delete Volume", "Release Floating IP")
- Reused across all resource types via generic action routing

### Phase 4: Refactor, Octavia, Projects, Quotas (Complete)

#### App Refactor
- Split monolithic `app.go` (1,643 lines) into 7 focused files with no logic changes
- Replaced hardcoded `activeTab` enum with dynamic `TabDef` registry — tabs are now data-driven
- Tab number keys `1-9` map dynamically to index position; arrow keys cycle with modulo
- Tab availability determined at connection time based on service catalog

#### Service Catalog Detection
- Octavia (Load Balancer) service detected optionally via `openstack.NewLoadBalancerV2`
- Block Storage detected optionally (try v3, v2, v1 — same as before)
- Tabs built conditionally: Volumes only if Cinder, Load Balancers only if Octavia
- Clouds without optional services work normally — those tabs simply don't appear

#### Load Balancer Management (Octavia)
- **Combined View**: Merged list+detail with search/filter, tree structure (Listeners → Pools → Members)
- **Create LB** (`Ctrl+N`): Form with name, VIP subnet, VIP address
- **Create Listener** (`Ctrl+N` on LB): Protocol, port, connection limit
- **Create Pool** (`Ctrl+N` on listener): Algorithm, protocol, session persistence
- **Create Member** (`Ctrl+N` on pool): Address, port, weight, subnet
- **Create Health Monitor** (`Ctrl+N` on pool): Type, delay, timeout, max retries
- **Edit**: Members (weight, admin state), pools, listeners
- **Delete** (`Ctrl+D`): Cascade delete for LBs, individual delete for listeners/pools/members/monitors
- **Bulk member operations**: Add multiple members at once
- Status colors: ACTIVE/ONLINE=green, PENDING_*=yellow, ERROR/OFFLINE=red

#### Project Switching (ALPHA — UNTESTED)
- After cloud connection, accessible projects fetched in background via Keystone `ListAvailable`
- If more than one project available, `P` key opens project picker modal
- Current project marked with `*` in picker
- On selection, re-authenticates scoped to new project via `ConnectWithProject` (overrides TenantID)
- All tabs reset on project switch (same as cloud switch)
- Project name shown in status bar between cloud and region

#### Quota Overlay
- `Q` key opens full-screen quota overlay (same pattern as help)
- Three sections: Compute (instances, cores, RAM, key pairs, server groups), Network (floating IPs, networks, ports, routers, security groups, subnets), Block Storage (volumes, gigabytes, snapshots, backups)
- ASCII progress bars (18 chars wide) with color coding: green (<70%), yellow (70-90%), red (>90%)
- Unlimited quotas (limit=-1) shown as "used / unlimited" with no bar
- Lazy fetch on open, cached for 30 seconds
- Scroll support, close with `Q` or `Esc`
- Block Storage section omitted if Cinder unavailable

### Phase 5: Quality of Life (Partial)

- **Upload** (`Ctrl+N`): Local file picker or URL import with disk format auto-detection (qcow2, raw, vmdk, vdi, iso, vhd, aki, ari, ami). Auto-fills image name from filename. Progress bar with atomic counters
- **Download** (`d`): Stream image to local file with directory picker and overwrite protection. Progress bar
- **Edit** (`e`): Modify name, visibility, min disk/RAM, tags, protected flag
- **Delete Image** (`Ctrl+D`): Confirmation modal, works from list or detail
- **Deactivate/Reactivate**: Toggle image availability

#### SSH Integration (`x` / `y`)
- Launch SSH session directly from server list or detail view (`x` key)
- SSH prompt with IP selection (floating IP, IPv4, IPv6 — IPv6 preferred when available)
- Copy SSH command to clipboard (`y` key)
- Option to ignore host key checking

#### Copy-to-Clipboard (`Y`)
- `Y` opens a copy-field picker modal on every list/detail view
- Arrow keys + Enter to copy; `1`-`9` number row for quick-pick
- Fields surfaced per resource:
  - Server: ID, Name, each IPv4/IPv6/Floating IP (one row per address)
  - Volume: ID, Name
  - Floating IP: ID, Floating Address, Fixed IP, Port ID
  - Network: Network ID/Name; focused subnet's ID/Name/CIDR/Gateway; focused port's ID/Name/MAC/Fixed IPs
  - Router: ID, Name, External Gateway IPv4/IPv6/Network ID; focused interface's Subnet/Port/IP
  - Security group: ID, Name; focused rule's ID; focused attached server ID
  - Load balancer: LB ID/Name/VIP; focused listener/pool/member ID/Name (and member Address)
  - Image: ID, Name, Checksum, Owner; focused attached server ID
  - Keypair: Name (list); Name + Public key (detail)
- Empty fields are skipped so the menu never shows placeholders
- Clipboard writes emit `"Copied <label>: <value>"` to the status bar; errors surface as `"Clipboard error: …"`

#### Server Cloning (`c`)
- Clone a server with its configuration (flavor, network, key pair, security groups)
- Progress view showing clone status

#### Console Access (`V`)
- Retrieve VNC console URL from Nova
- Opens URL in default browser

#### Cross-Resource Navigation

- Jump from volume detail to attached server
- Resource links are navigable with keyboard

#### Self-Update
- `--update` flag downloads latest release from GitHub
- `--no-check-update` skips automatic version check on startup
- Downloads binary for current OS/architecture with SHA256 checksum verification

- **Buttons**: Styled with background color, highlight on focus (green for confirm/submit, red for cancel/deny)
- **Branding**: LAZYSTACK pill badge in top-right, dark text on purple background

## Future Roadmap

### Backlog (deferred from Phase 3 — all complete)
- ✅ **Create Volume form** — name, size, type picker, AZ, description
- ✅ **Create/Import Key Pair** — RSA/ED25519, file browser, save-to-file
- ✅ **Create Security Group Rule** — modal with cycle pickers
- ✅ **Volume Attach from detail** — server picker modal
- ✅ **Network/subnet browsing** — Networks tab with expandable subnets, port CRUD, subnet edit

### Server Action Gaps

Actions available in Nova but not yet implemented, prioritized by usefulness:

#### High-value (all complete)
- ✅ **Rename server** — `r` key, inline rename
- ✅ **Rebuild** — `Ctrl+G`, image picker modal
- ✅ **Create snapshot** — `Ctrl+S`, creates image from server
- ✅ **Rescue/Unrescue** — `Ctrl+W`, toggle rescue mode

#### Medium-value (specific scenarios)
- ✅ **Console access (noVNC)** — Retrieve and open VNC console URL via `V` key. Opens in browser or copies to clipboard.
- **Get password** — Retrieve auto-generated password for Windows VMs (`servers.GetPassword`).

#### Admin-only (Phase 6)
- **Migrate / Live Migrate** — Move server to different hypervisor. Admin privilege required.
- **Evacuate** — Emergency recovery from failed host. Admin-only.
- **Force Delete** — Bypass normal deletion flow. Admin-only.
- **Reset State** — Force server into a specific state. Recovery from stuck transitions.
- **Metadata browser** — Full CRUD on server metadata key-value pairs.

### Phase 5: Quality of Life (remaining)
- Configuration file (`~/.config/lazystack/config.yaml`) for defaults
- Custom column selection and ordering
- Saved filters
- Server name templates for create
- ✅ SSH integration (launch SSH session to selected server) — Done (#27)
- ✅ Copy-to-clipboard for IDs, IPs — Done (#28): `Y` opens a field picker on every list/detail view (server, volume, network, subnet, router, port, LB + listener/pool/member, floating IP, security group, keypair, image). `y` still copies the SSH command on server views.
- Log/audit trail of actions taken
- Designate (DNS) tab
- ✅ Console access (noVNC URL retrieval and browser launch) — Done (#50)
- ✅ Image upload/download/edit with file picker and combined view — Done (#126)
- ✅ Cloud-init / user data file picker in server create — Done
- ✅ Port CRUD with port security and allowed address pairs — Done
- ✅ Subnet edit modal — Done
- ✅ IPv6 subnet support (address mode, RA mode, auto-addressed subnets) — Done
- ✅ Search/filter (`/`) on all list views — Done
- ✅ Load balancer full CRUD (create/edit/delete LB, listeners, pools, members, monitors) — Done
- ✅ Server cloning with progress view — Done

### Phase 6: Operational
- Hypervisor view (admin)
- User management (admin)
- Service catalog browser
- Migrate/evacuate, force delete, reset state (see Server Action Gaps above)

## Non-Goals

- **Mouse-driven interaction**: This is a keyboard-first tool. Mouse support may come later but is not a priority.
- **Full Horizon replacement**: lazystack focuses on the most common operations. Rarely-used Horizon features (e.g., orchestration, identity management) are out of scope.
- **Multi-platform OpenStack alternatives**: This tool is specifically for OpenStack, not a generic cloud TUI.
- **Configuration management**: lazystack is for interactive operations, not declarative infrastructure management (use Terraform/OpenTofu for that).

## Success Criteria

1. `go build` produces a single binary with zero runtime dependencies
2. Connects to any standard OpenStack cloud via `clouds.yaml`
3. Server list loads and auto-refreshes without manual intervention
4. Full VM lifecycle (list, inspect, create, delete, reboot, pause, suspend, shelve, resize) from keyboard
5. All destructive actions require Ctrl-prefix and explicit confirmation
6. Responsive at terminal sizes from 80x20 upward
7. Bulk operations work on multi-selected servers
8. Console log and action history accessible per server
